`ProductionML` is a _collective of data scientists and data engineers_ who want to enhance their knowledge of running state of art machine learning applications in production, at scale. We aim to democratize cutting edge research in this area and help bridge the gap between data scientists and data engineers to expedite the adoption of machine learning as outlined in our [manifesto]({{ '/manifesto/'| prepend: site.baseurl }}).

> To make great products: **do machine learning like the great engineer you are, not like the great machine learning expert you aren't** <sup>[[1](http://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/rules_of_ml.pdf)]</sup>.

All of our collective intelligence from workshops, talks, meetups is captured [here]({{site.baseurl}}/cointelligence/).
