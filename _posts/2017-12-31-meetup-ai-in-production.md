### What we'll do
Model Development != Software Development; there exists a gap between when data scientists build a model to when data/software engineers integrate it with the rest of the enterprise ecosystem and put it into production. We are working on the Manifesto of a ProductionML social which will help bridge this gap and help participants progress over a maturity spectrum which has offline model training at one end and dynamic model deployment+serving on the other supported with online training. This workshop/session will serve as a bridge for ProductionML. The objective of this workshop will be to help data science professionals become more knowledgeable about Cloud Computing and demo how to serve a simple model behind a RESTful API in a Docker Container.
