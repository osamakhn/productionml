> Using machine learning in real-world production systems is complicated by a host of issues not found in small toy examples or even large offline research experiments. Testing and monitoring are key considerations for assessing the production-readiness of an ML system. But how much testing and monitoring is enough? We present an ML Test Score rubric based on a set of actionable tests to help quantify these issues [^1].

## Compute your ML test score
> For each test, one point is awarded for executing the test manually and documenting and distributing the results. A second point is awarded if there is a system in place to run that test automatically on a repeated basis. The final ML Test Score is computed by taking the minimum of the scores aggregated for each of the 4 sections below.
